- Product questions:
1) Are we building something like a board of projects where users can change statuses of them and add comments only or is there assigning, etc?
- We only leave comments and change status just for now
2) How many statuses are there for a project? and what are they?
- There are 4 statuses; To do, In progress, In review, Done and you can only revert adjacent statuses.
3) Can i reply to a comment?
- You can only leave a comment on the project no replies
4) What should the UI look like?
- The UI for a certain project should have the project name and description, along with the status changes that happened for it and the comments beneath that.
5) Does the user have to create an account on the platform or can he use oauth for an easier experience
- The user can use google sign in instead of having to create an account on the platform.
6) Who creates a project? or do we assume they already exist and act accordingly?
- Assume projects are already created (seeded already)
